module Substation

  # Implements a chain of responsibility for an action
  #
  # An instance of this class will typically contain (in that order)
  # a few processors that process the incoming {Request} object, one
  # processor that calls an action ({Chain::Pivot}), and some processors
  # that process the outgoing {Response} object.
  #
  # Both {Chain::Incoming} and {Chain::Outgoing} processors must
  # respond to `#call(response)` and `#result(response)`.
  #
  # @example chain processors (used in instance method examples)
